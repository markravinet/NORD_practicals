## Overview

Welcome to the website for Nord 2022 BIO9001 course. Today we are going to learn how to infer selection in the genome and then learn about identifying introgression.

### Inferring selection

1. [Carry out a sliding window-analysis of *F*<sub>ST</sub> and *d*<sub>XY</sub> on a dataset of *Passer* sparrows](practical1.html)
2. [Calculate haplotype homozygosity statistics between two *Passer* sparrow species](practical2.html)
3. [Use this pairwise analysis to identify candidate genes in the genome](practical3.html)

### Admixture, introgression and gene flow

4. [Detect introgression and admixture between species using D statistics](practical4.html)
